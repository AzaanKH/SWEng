# Introduction to SW Engineeting

**DISCLAIMER:** *This material is heavily inspired (and sometimes copied with permission) of the [UW's CSE403 course by René Just](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/courses/CSE403/index.html).*

This intro to Software Engineering is project-based as we believe you'll take a lot more from the short lectures if you practice the discussed concepts and principleds. There is a catch: the project is a vehicle, not the outcome. Your **ability to deal with the tools and techniques** created throughout the history of Software Engineering is the place you should pay attention to.

## WHAT?

Let's get this out of the way: **What is Software Engineering?**

1. A more formal way to see it: "an engineering discipline (hence, uses science to improve applicability and efficiency) that is concerned with all aspects of software production." — Ian Sommerville
2. The way we will kind of see it here: a set of principles to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software.
3. Also: A whole research field that study what such principles are and what tools can support to deliver better software.
