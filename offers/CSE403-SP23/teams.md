## RCRS: Resilient Course Registration System
We hope to build on top of the current UW regsitration system. We will be improving the system by improving on current tools of the registration system, for example we will be
improving the transparency of the website. We will also add new features such as an add
in code system that is within the registration system which makes the add in code process
more steamlined.
