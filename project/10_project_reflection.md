# Course project: Individual Reflection

## Overview

Reflect on your project experience and your achieved learning goals.

## Setup

**Individually reflect** on your overall project and learning experience.

## Instructions

### 1. Write an individual retrospective (100%)

Write a 1-2 page retrospective (on your own) of lessons learned from
the project experience. The lessons can be in terms of specifications,
design, planning, implementation, tooling, teamwork, etc. Below are some
questions that you might answer, though the format and specifics are up
to you. You will be graded on the thoughtfulness, insights, and justifications
of your answers, not on what you actually believe.

Example questions:

* What worked well?

* What would you do differently next time?

* What do you wish you had known ahead of time?

* What surprised you?

* What do you now believe that you did not believe at the beginning of the quarter, and why?

* What ideas taught in class do you still not believe, and why?

* What advice would you give future CSE 403 students?

* Are you happy/proud of the work you completed? If not, why, and what could
  you (not others) have changed so that you were happy/proud of your
  accomplishments? Do you think others on your team feel the same way?

### 2. Submit this individual reflection as a PDF document to Canvas by due date. *(Check Calendar!)*
