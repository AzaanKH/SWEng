# Course project: Git Setup

## Overview

Set up a GitHub Project to call your own.

## Setup

Work with your project team.  There's no other set up this time.

## Instructions

### 1. Create your GitHub repo (30%)

Create a public repository for your project on GitHub, make all team members
contributors, and add a link to this repository to your living document.

### 2. Add a top-level README.md file (20%)

The top-level README should briefly describe the idea and goals of your project
and explain the layout of the repository.

### 3. Start planning your project tasks by [creating issues](https://github.com/features/issues).

Managing *issues* or *tasks* or *bugs* is a very common feature of project management tools like GitHub.
We highly recommend you use it as your main way for team coordination.
Don't try to be perfect with planning, just start putting as many tasks down as you can imagine. (You can always delete them later!) 

### 4. Add [bookmarks](https://slack.com/help/articles/205239997-Pin-messages-and-bookmark-links) in your Slack channel pointing to your GitHub repository and your living document.

### 5. Start experimenting and setting up resources

Next week's milestone will have you finalize your system's architecture and
design, but start exploring, prototyping, and setting up resources. For example,
if your project requires setting up a web or SQL server, get started on this
task and add relevant instructions and information to your Git repository.

### 6. Review and follow the [Git conflict resolution tutorial](https://rawgit.com/mernst/git-conflict-tutorial/master/git-conflict-resolution.html). When merge conflicts come up later in the quarter, you will be happy that you did.

### 7. Submit the link to your repository on Canvas by due date. *(Check Calendar!)*


## Clarifications

### Should one person write and commit the status report to the Git repository, or should we each commit our own part of the report?

This is up to you, but in the past teams have found it easiest to write the
report collaboratively, either through GitHub or by writing the markdown file
in a Google doc before committing it to the repository.

### I've never used Markdown before, where do I start?

[This](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is a great introduction to writing Markdown!
